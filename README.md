The proposed project aims to apply Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) technology for the 3D reconstruction of standard cars, utilizing images captured through smartphones. NeRF has emerged as a revolutionary technique in computer vision, capable of producing photorealistic 3D models from sparse 2D images by modeling the volumetric scene representation. This project will explore the implementation of NeRF for creating detailed 3D representations of standard cars and desks.
